            <p>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams,
                most commonly of five players each, 
                opposing one another on a rectangular court,
                compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter)
                through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court)
                while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop.
            </p>
            <p>
                A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line,
                when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one,
                two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied,
                an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.

            <p>
                In basketball there are <span>5</span> different positions of which each of the players on the field must fulfill that role so that the team has a balance between its players. <br><br>
            The positions are as follows:

                </li>
                <p>
                        Point guard (often called the "<span>1</span>") : usually the fastest player on the team, organizes the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Shooting guard (the "<span>2</span>") : creates a high volume of shots on offense, mainly long-ranged; and guards the opponent's best perimeter player on defense
                </p>
                <li>

                <p>
                    Small forward (the "<span>3</span>") : often primarily responsible for scoring points via cuts to the basket and dribble penetration; on defense seeks rebounds and steals, but sometimes plays more actively.
                </p>
                <li>
                    <h2 id="Power_forward">Power forward</h2>

                <p>
                    Power forward (the "<span>4</span>"): plays offensively often with their back to the basket; on defense, plays under the basket (in a zone defense) or against the opposing power forward (in man-to-man defense).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Center (the "<span>5</span>"): uses height and size to score (on offense), to protect the basket closely (on defense), or to rebound.

                </li>
                <p>Dribbling is the act of bouncing the ball continuously with one hand and is a requirement for a player to take steps with the ball. To dribble, a player pushes the ball down towards the ground with the fingertips rather than patting it; this ensures greater control.</p>

                <p>
                    Shooting is the act of attempting to score points by throwing the ball through the basket, methods varying with players and situations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Typically, a player faces the basket with both feet facing the basket. A player will rest the ball on the fingertips of the dominant hand (the shooting arm) slightly above the head, with the other hand supporting the side of the ball. The ball is usually shot by jumping (though not always) and extending the shooting arm.

                </li>
                <p> el salto en el baloncesto es una habilidad que te puede hacer mas peligroso a la hora de ejecutar cualquier movimiento
                    The objective of rebounding is to successfully gain possession of the basketball after a missed field goal or free throw, as it rebounds from the hoop or backboard. This plays a major role in the game, as most possessions end when a team misses a shot.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A pass is a method of moving the ball between players. Most passes are accompanied by a step forward to increase power and are followed through with the hands to ensure accuracy.

                To play basketball you don't need much more than desire, but to be very good at this sport you need skills that you should develop as you play.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Strength</span>: Strength is important in every sport, and basketball being a high-contact sport, you need a fair amount of strength to withstand that contact
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Speed</span>: speed in this sport is of the utmost importance depending on what type of player you are, in the nba it is said that the average speed is 7.1km per hour.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Jump</span>: jumping in basketball is a skill that can make you more dangerous when executing any movement.
            </p>
            <p>   
                <span>Intelligence</span>: intelligence is normally seen in point guards, and the more intelligent they are because they are betproyectoster and more structured,<br> such as having a variable in programming  and having a function . The function works better than a simple addition

            <p>The object of the game is to outscore one's opponents by throwing the ball through the opponents' basket from above while preventing the opponents from doing so on their own. An attempt to score in this way is called a shot. A successful shot is worth two points, or three points if it is taken from beyond the three-point arc 6.75 metres (22 ft 2 in) from the basket in international games[36] and 23 feet 9 inches (7.24 m) in NBA games.[37] A one-point shot can be earned when shooting from the foul line after a foul is made. After a team has scored from a field goal or free throw, play is resumed with a throw-in awarded to the non-scoring team taken from a point beyond the endline of the court where the points were scored.[38]
